Problem solving approach
------------------------

Algorithm: a process/set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

How do you get better at it?
	1. Devise a plan for solving problems.
	2. Master common problem solving patterns.

PROBLEM SOLVING:
 * Understand the problem.
 * Explore concrete examples.
 * Break it down.
 * Solve/Simplify.
 * Look back and Refactor.

STEP 1:	UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM:
	Before you start typing away... take a minute to make sure you understand the problem.
	ask yourself:	- can you restate the problem in your own words? (reword the question to make sure you understand it)
			- what are the inputs that go into the problem?  
			- what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
			- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?	(i.e. do you have enough info to solve the problem)
			- how should you label the important pieces of the data that are a part of the problem?

	EXAMPLE:
	Write a function that takes two numbers and returns their sum.

			- can you restate the problem in your own words? 
				"write a function that adds two numbers"

			- what are the inputs that go into the problem?  
				"what are the numbers... int or floating point....or string?
				"how large are the numbers?
				
			- what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
				"must the output be a float, an int, or can it be a string"

			- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?	(i.e. do you have enough info to solve the problem)
				"what do you do if the user only supplies one number...?"

			- how should you label the important pieces of the data that are a part of the problem?
				"what are you going you to call the variables and output? num1, num2, total...etc"


STEP 2: EXPLORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES:
	- start with simple examples.
	- progress to more complex examples.
	- explore examples with empty inputs.
	- explore examples with invalid inputs.

	EXAMPLE:
	Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each charater in the string.

	- So start by writing a simple example:	
		charCount("aabbbccc")	//return {a:2, b:3, c:3}	
	  	...should it include characters that aren't in the string, like ...d:0}
	
	- Then ask more complex examples:
		"My phone number is 011 8234 2020"	- should it count numbers, spaces, capital letters?
	
	- Explore examples with empty inputs:
		charCount("")				- what should you do if the input is an empty string. return {}... null... 0.. error?
		
	- Explore examples with invalid input:
		charCount(100)				- what should it return..??? should you convert it to a string..?




Byron
STEP 3: BREAK IT DOWN:
	- write down the steps you need to take. It forces you to think about the process, and give you some structure.
		
	EXAMPLE:
	Write a function that returns the count of each letter in an array.  "a, a, b, b, b, c, c, c, c"
		
		//what must it return?
		{a:2;
		 b:3;
		 c:4;
		 }


		function charCount(str) {
			//make an object
			//loop over string
				//if char is letter/number AND is a key in object, add one to count.
				//if char is letter/number AND NOT in object, add it to object and set count to 1.
				//if char is not letter/number, don't do anything.
			//return object
		}

		



STEP 4: SOLVE OR SIMPLIFY:
Solve the problem if you can. and if you can't solve the simple parts that you can do.. can come back to the problem you're stuck on.

	EXAMPLE: same as above.
		
		if you have trouble with looping - try write the code with only one charater (instead of the whole string). try to process it
		as you would if it were part of the loop... and then come back to the loop and the string array.
		
		function charCount(str) {
			//make an object
			*****var obj = {};
			//loop over string
				//if char is letter/number AND is a key in object, add one to count.
				******
				//if char is letter/number AND NOT in object, add it to object and set count to 1.
				******
				//if char is not letter/number, don't do anything.
			//return object
		}


Byron
STEP 5: LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR:
...see how you can improve your code.

	- can you check the resluts (i.e. does your code work)
	- can you derive the code differently? (is there a different a way to approach it)
	- can you understand it at a glance? (does your code make sense... is it understandable)
	- can you use the method for some other problem? (...maybe something else you are working on)
	- can you improve the performance?
	- can you think of other ways to refactor it?
	- how have other people solved the problem?
	

	EXAMPLE:
	instead of....  for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; ++i) {
	use.....	for (var i of arr) {
